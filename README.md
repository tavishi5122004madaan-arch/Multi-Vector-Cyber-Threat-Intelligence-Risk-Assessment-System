# Multi-Vector-Cyber-Threat-Intelligence-Risk-Assessment-System
A PhD-level cybersecurity framework that analyzes URLs, email subjects, and embedded scripts to detect phishing, social engineering, and obfuscated malware attacks.

The system uses entropy analysis, anomaly detection, behavioral indicators, and statistical modeling to generate a unified cyber threat percentage score.

It provides interactive visualizations (Radar, Heatmap, 3D Threat Landscape, Bar Graph) and automatically generates a professional threat intelligence report.
